## Installation <a name="installation"></a>

## Project Motivation<a name="motivation"></a>

Perform customer segmentation to determine which part of the population to target with a new mail order campaign.


## File Descriptions <a name="methods"></a>

There is one notebooks and one blogpost to showcase work related to the above question.   

## Methods <a name="files"></a>
1. Customer Segmentation Report
I will use unsupervised learning methods to analyze attributes of established customers and the general population in order to create customer segments.

2. Supervised Learning Model
I will use the previous analysis to build a machine learning model that predicts whether or not each individual will respond to the campaign.

3. Kaggle Competition
Once I've chosen a model, I'll use it to make predictions on the campaign data as part of a Kaggle Competition. You'll rank the individuals by how likely they are to convert to being a customer, and see how my model measure up against fellow students.

## Results<a name="results"></a>

The main findings of the code can be found at the post available [here](https://fmakayi.github.io/).
